## About Me
I'm a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in English Language and Literature at Shandong University, working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=oQzY0ZwAAAAJ" target="_blank"> Hao Zhang</a>. My research areas include experimental phonetics, second/foreign language acquisition, and psycholinguistics.
For my undergraduate thesis, I employed behavioral and eye-tracking methodologies to investigate the impact of musical experience on the production and perception of English vowels among Mandarin-speaking second language learners. Recently, I started studying the efficacy of musical training and sleep-mediated memory consolidation in facilitating the acquisition of Cantonese level tones, particularly examining their influence on speakers of tonal languages like Mandarin as well as non-tonal languages such as English and Korean.



## Research Interests
- Production and Perception of Non-native Language
- Cross-domain Transfer Effects between Music and Language Experience
- Age-related Differences in Language Learning

## Research Experience
[2024-present] <strong>Efficacy of Melodic Training and Sleep-mediated Memory Consolidation in Learning Cantonese Level Tones by Native Speakers of Mandarin and English</strong><br>
- Conducted extensive literature review to inform research direction.
- Currently leading efforts to recruit 120 college students, comprising 60 Mandarin speakers and 60 English speakers, to engage in the <a href="#melodicTraining2023">music training program and associated assessments,</a> developed as part of my previous study.







[2023-2024] <strong>Benefits of Melodic Training on the Production and Perception of Cantonese Level Tones by Korean and Chinese Older Adults</strong> <br>
<ul>
    <li>Conducted comprehensive literature review to inform research methodology.</li>
    <li id="melodicTraining2023">Developed and implemented a Melodic Height Identification Training program and associated assessments, utilizing JavaScript (<a href="https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/" target="_blank">jsPsych</a>).</li>
    <li>Successfully recruited and managed a cohort of 30 older adults, comprising 15 Korean and 15 Chinese participants, for the research project.</li>
    <li>Utilized <a href="https://sppas.org/" target="_blank">SPPAS</a> and <a href="https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Montreal Forced Aligner</a> for automatic annotation of production data, and automatically extracted F0 values in MATLAB (<a href="https://phonetics.ucla.edu/voicesauce/" target="_blank">VoiceSauce</a>).</li>
    <li>Analyzed participants' tone differentiability and hit rate to assess production performance and Utilized onset and offset F0 values to generate tone overlap plots, organized by group (Mandarin, Korean) and test phase (pretest, posttest1, posttest2).</li>
    <li>Transformed perception data (accuracy percentages) into rationalized arcsine units (RAUs) for statistical analysis.</li>
    <li>Conducted Linear Mixed Effects analysis using R (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html" target="_blank">lme4</a>) to examine the effects of melodic training on Cantonese level tones perception and production.</li>

[2023-2024] **Perception-Production Links in Mandarin Speakers' English Vowels: A Behavioral and Eye-tracking Study**<br>
- Conducted literature review.
- Synthesized and manipulated experimental stimuli in MATLAB (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4518514" target="_blank">TANDEM-STRAIGHT</a>).
- Designed eye-tracking experimenst using <a href="https://www.sr-research.com/experiment-builder/" target="_blank">Experiment Builder</a>. 
- Recruited 50 collage students to participte in this project.
- Conducted automatic anotation for production data using <a href="https://sppas.org/" target="_blank">SPPAS</a> and <a href="http://darla.dartmouth.edu/index" target="_blank">DARLA</a>, and automaticly extract F1 and F2 values for production data in MATLAB (<a href="https://phonetics.ucla.edu/voicesauce/" target="_blank">VoiceSauce</a>).
- Calculated participants' boundary width in Python to evaluate their perception performance.
- Processed eye-movement data in R (<a href="http://www.eyetracking-r.com/" target="_blank">eyetrackingR</a>) and calculated the difference between the empirical logtransformed proportions of target and competitor fixations on a per-participant basis.
- Calculated participants' Pillai score in R to measure vowel overlap and used F1 and F2 values to plot vowel overlap in R (<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank">ggplot2</a>)
- Conducted LME and GCA analysis analysis in R (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html" target="_blank">lme4</a>)




[2023] **Music Experience Enhances Categorical Perception of English Vowels in Mandarin Speakers**
- Conducted literature review, synthesized and manipulated experimental stimuli in MATLAB (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4518514" target="_blank">TANDEM-STRAIGHT</a>).
- Recruited 20 collage students to participate in this project.
- Designed and conducted experiments in <a href="https://www.psychopy.org/" target="_blank">Psychopy</a>.
- Performed ANOVA and Pearson correlation analysis in Python (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pandas/" target="_blank">Pandas</a>).
- Wrote the manuscript.
