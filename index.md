working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=oQzY0ZwAAAAJ" target="_blank"> Hao Zhang</a>. My research areas include experimental phonetics, second/foreign language acquisition, and psycholinguistics. My study uses behavioral (e.g. eye-tracking) method to test how musical aptitude influences the production and perception of English vowels by Mandarin-speaking L2 learners. I recently started studying the efficacy of musical training and sleep-mediated memory consolidation in learning Cantonese level tones by tonal (e.g. Mandarin) and non-tonal language (e.g. English and Korean) speakers.
