## About Me

<!-- I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Statistics</a> Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> New York University</a>, -->
I'm a fourth-year undergraduate in English Language and Literature at Shandong University,

<!-- , specifically within the <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/research/sackler-institute-graduate-biomedical-sciences/" target="_blank"> Vilcek institute of Biomedical Sciences</a> and the Department of <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/" target="_blank"> Population Health</a>.

working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=oQzY0ZwAAAAJ" target="_blank"> Hao Zhang</a>. My research areas include experimental phonetics, second/foreign language acquisition, and psycholinguistics. My undergraduate thesis used behavioral and eye-tracking methods to test how musical experience influences the production and perception of English vowels by Mandarin-speaking L2 learners. Recently, I started studying the efficacy of musical training and sleep-mediated memory consolidation in learning Cantonese level tones by tonal (e.g. Mandarin) and non-tonal language (e.g. English and Korean) speakers.

<br>This ongoing project plans to recruit 120 college students (60 Mandarin speakrs and 60 English speakers) to participant in the<a href="https://lexie-liang.github.io/LiangJiayu.github.io/#:~:text=%5B2023%2Dpresent%5D%20Benefits%20of%20Melodic%20Training%20on%20the%20Production%20and%20Perception%20of%20Cantonese%20Level%20Tones%20by%20Korean%20and%20Chinese%20Older%20Adults" target="_blank"> music traiing program</a> I have designed for the previous study. I will be in charge of the Mandarin speakers' experiments.
