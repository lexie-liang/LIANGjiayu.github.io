## About Me

<!-- I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Statistics</a> Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> New York University</a>, -->
I'm a fourth-year undergraduate in English Language and Literature at Shandong University,
<!-- 's <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> Grossman School of Medicine</a> -->
<!-- , specifically within the <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/research/sackler-institute-graduate-biomedical-sciences/" target="_blank"> Vilcek institute of Biomedical Sciences</a> and the Department of <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/" target="_blank"> Population Health</a>.

working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=oQzY0ZwAAAAJ" target="_blank"> Hao Zhang</a>. My research areas include experimental phonetics, second/foreign language acquisition, and psycholinguistics. My undergraduate thesis used behavioral and eye-tracking methods to test how music experience influences the production and perception of English vowels by Mandarin-speaking L2 learners. Recently, I started studying the efficacy of musical training and sleep-mediated memory consolidation in learning Cantonese level tones by tonal (e.g. Mandarin) and non-tonal language (e.g. English and Korean) speakers. 



## Research Interests
- Production and Perception of Non-native Language
- Cross-domain Transfer Effects between Music and Language Experience

## Research Experience
[2024-present] <strong>Efficacy of Melodic Training and Sleep-mediated Memory Consolidation in Learning Cantonese Level Tones by Native Speakers of Mandarin and English</strong><br>
- Conducted literature review.
- Aims to recruit 120 college students (60 Mandarin speakers and 60 English speakers) to participate in the <a href="#melodicTraining2023">music training program</a> I have designed for the previous study. <br>

<ul>
    <li id="melodicTraining2023">Conducted literature review</li>
    <li>Designed a Melodic Height Identification Training program and Training Assessments (identification and discrimination tests), based on JavaScript (<a href="https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/" target="_blank">jsPsych</a>).</li>
    <li>Recruited 30 older adults (15 Korean, 15 Chinese) to participate in this project.</li>
    <li>Conducted automatic annotation for production data using <a href="https://sppas.org/" target="_blank">SPPAS</a> and <a href="https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Montreal Forced Aligner</a>.</li>
    <li>Performed automatic extraction of F0 values for production data in MATLAB (<a href="https://phonetics.ucla.edu/voicesauce/" target="_blank">VoiceSauce</a>).</li>
    <li>Calculated participants' <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.592954/full" target="_blank">tone differentiability</a> and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.592954/full" target="_blank">hit rate</a> for their production performance.</li>
    <li>Used onset and offset F0 values to plot tone overlap on a per-group (Mandarin, Korean) and per-test (pretest, posttest1, posttest2) basis.</li>
    <li>Transformed perception data (accuracy percentages) into rationalized arcsine units (<a href="https://pubs.asha.org/doi/abs/10.1044/jshr.2803.455" target="_blank">RAUs</a>).</li>
